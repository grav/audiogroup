OCTAVELIB

Some functions for Octave

WAVPLAY
Usage: wavplay(x,fs)

Play x at samplerate fs.

Note: Wavplay uses wavwrite to write a wave-file to disk, after which it
plays the file using mplayer and then deletes it. Just edit the file
to use another player.

BANDPASS
Usage: h = bandpass(n,fs,low,high)
Creates an n-pole bandpass FIR-filter going from freq. low to high at samplerate fs and saves it in h.

Note: Requires the FIR1	function which is available in the Signal-package.

DBPLOT
Usage: dbplot(y,fs)
Plots the frequency spectrum of y on a log-lin graph, converting amplitude to dB.
