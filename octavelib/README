OCTAVELIB

Some functions for Octave 3.
Tested in Octave 3.0.1 on Mac OS X.

To use the functions, either place them in the working directory or add the whole octavelib-directory to Octave's path by adding the following line to ~/.octaverc:

addpath (genpath ("/path/to/octavelib"));

WAVPLAY
Usage: wavplay(x,fs)
Play x at samplerate fs.

Note: wavplay uses the built-in wavwrite to write a wave-file to disk, after which it
plays the file using mplayer and then deletes it. Just edit the file
to use another player.

BANDPASS
Usage: h = bandpass(n,fs,low,high)
Creates an n-pole bandpass FIR-filter going from freq. low to high at samplerate fs and saves it in h.

Note: Requires the FIR1	function which is available in the Signal-package.

DBPLOT
Usage: dbplot(y,fs)
Plots the frequency spectrum of y on a log-lin graph, converting amplitude to dB.
